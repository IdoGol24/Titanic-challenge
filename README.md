# The Titanic Challenge
I used the Sklearn Logistic Regression to build a model that would complete the challenge.
I cleaned the data from null values that was not affecting or indicated survival. 
For null values that were in other attributes(that were vital for the model) , I tried to fill them in a sense that those values would not change the variance as much as possible.
